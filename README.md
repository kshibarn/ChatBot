# ChatBot
## Description

Sanctum is one of my personal project AI ChatBot which is specially been designed by me for the people who suffers from depression in their day-to-day life. It is been seen that who suffers from depression there is a strong reson behind them and they first to confirm it's depreesion or not they check the symptoms which sanctum can tell by asking him "What are the signs and symptoms of depression?" the chatbot can answer basic question very easily. It can also help in telling how to treat depression and live life in norwal ways as everyone is living. 

We used Python libraries and Deep learning concept using tensorflow and keras libraries to train the chatbot in "training.py" file. We trained out chatbot thorougly and used NLP concept to handle the json file which helped in training smoothly. Finally we created our main file "chatbot.py" where we assemble everything and created Sanctum as our chatbot which helps people suffering from depression and guides the path along with it.
